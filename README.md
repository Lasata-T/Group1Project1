# Group1Project1
## Section 1: Software and Platform
For this project, our group attempted to download the R3 data directly from the GSS website. However, the only file formats available were SAS, STATA, and SPSS. None of the three file formats were conducive to our Python script, which we were working on using Google Colab. To readjust, we downloaded the text data into a `.csv` format from a separate GitHub repository.

After receiving the data and downloading it into our Python script in Google Colab, we imported the following packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`. All of the code was run on a Lenovo laptop supporting the Windows platform. 

## Section 2: Documentation Map
Our Project 1 repository is titled Group1Project1. It contains three folders (SCRIPTS, DATA, and OUTPUT), a MIT LICENSE file, and a README.md file. The SCRIPTS folder contains a master script which contains all the code needed to reproduce our data and analysis. The DATA folder contains the original dataset and the modified dataset used for the analysis. The OUTPUT folder contains all the exploratory plots, the classification tree model, and the evaluation metrics.
